# UMG Widget Tests

Tests for creating and configuring UI widgets. Run sequentially.

---

## Setup

Create a widget blueprint called TestWidget in the Blueprints folder. if it already exsits delete it silently and create a new one.

---

## Initial State

What's in the widget right now?

---

Is there a root element?

---

## Finding Widget Types

What button types are available in the common category?

---

What panel containers can I use?

---

Show me the text block options.

---

## Adding UI Elements

Add a play button.

---

Add a title text element.

---

Add a background image.

---

Add a vertical box container for menu layout.

---

Show me all the widgets now.

---

Save the widget blueprint.

---

Open the widget blueprint in the editor to verify it compiles without errors.

---

## Text Configuration

What properties does the title text have?

---

Set the text to "Main Menu".

---

Make it white.

---

Bump up the font size.

---

Verify those changes.

---

## Layout Properties

The background should fill the whole screen horizontally.

---

And vertically too.

---

Center the play button.

---

Check those layout settings.

---

## Event Bindings

First create a function called OnPlayClicked on the widget blueprint. Then bind the play button's
OnClicked event to call it.

---

Prove the binding is real, not just a "success" return value: list the nodes in the EventGraph and
confirm there is a K2Node_ComponentBoundEvent titled "On Clicked (PlayButton)", and that its exec
("then") output is connected to the OnPlayClicked function call. (A stub that only logs the request
would leave the EventGraph with no such node — that is the regression we are guarding against.)

---

Bind the same OnClicked event a second time and confirm it did NOT create a duplicate event node —
there should still be exactly one ComponentBoundEvent for PlayButton.

---

Try to bind a non-existent event named "OnBogusEvent" on the play button. This must report failure
(return False) and must NOT create any node — binding should never silently claim success for an
event that doesn't exist. Use get_available_events to confirm OnBogusEvent isn't a real event.

---

Add a hover event too (bind OnHovered to a handler function you create first).

---

Verify the events are bound by re-reading the EventGraph and reporting the bound event nodes and
their wired function calls as evidence.

---

## Modifying Widgets

Remove the title text.

---

Show what's left in the widget.

---

## Building a Menu

Add some more buttons and text for a proper menu layout.

---

Configure the layout to look like a vertical menu.

---

## Complex Hierarchy Test

Create a nested widget structure to test GUID registration:
- Add a VerticalBox called "MainContainer"
- Inside MainContainer, add a HorizontalBox called "HeaderRow"
- Inside HeaderRow, add a TextBlock called "HeaderTitle"
- Add a ScrollBox called "ContentScroll" to MainContainer
- Inside ContentScroll, add a VerticalBox called "ItemList"

---

Save and verify the complex hierarchy compiles without GUID errors.

---

## Widget Property Validation

Verify that HeaderTitle text is actually set to what we configured earlier.

---

Check the HeaderRow's padding and alignment properties.

---

## Deep Nesting Test

Inside ItemList, add 3 HorizontalBoxes called "Item1", "Item2", "Item3".

---

Inside each Item box, add a TextBlock called "ItemLabel" and a Button called "ItemButton".

---

Save the widget and verify all 6 nested children compile correctly.

---

Show me the complete hierarchy structure now.

---

## Widget Renaming Test

Rename "ItemButton" in Item1 to "Item1_ActionButton".

---

Verify the rename worked and the GUID is preserved.

---

## Widget Reparenting Test

Move the background image to be a child of MainContainer instead of root.

---

Verify the widget moved correctly and hierarchy updated.

---

## Slot Properties Test

Set the vertical alignment of HeaderRow in MainContainer to Top.

---

Set the horizontal alignment to Fill.

---

Verify those slot properties are set correctly.

---

## Multiple Widget Test

Create a second widget blueprint called "TestWidget2" in the Blueprints folder.

---

Add a Canvas Panel to TestWidget2 as the root.

---

Add a Button at position (100, 100) with size (200, 50).

---

Save TestWidget2 and verify it compiles.

---

Switch back to TestWidget and verify it still has all our previous widgets.

---

## Widget Visibility Test

Set the visibility of ContentScroll to Hidden.

---

Verify the visibility property is set correctly.

---

Set it back to Visible.

---

## Z-Order Test

In TestWidget, show me the Z-order of all root-level widgets.

---

Move the play button to be rendered above the vertical box container.

---

Verify the Z-order changed.

---

## Widget Deletion Test

Remove Item3 from ItemList.

---

Verify Item3 is gone but Item1 and Item2 remain.

---

Remove all children from HeaderRow.

---

Verify HeaderRow is now empty.

---

## Event Handler Verification

Show me all the event bindings we've set up.

---

Verify that the play button's OnClicked event is still bound.

---

## Style Properties Test

Set the HeaderTitle font size to 24.

---

Set the font style to bold.

---

Set the text color to yellow.

---

Verify all three style changes are applied.

---

## Dedicated Font API Test

Use the dedicated font API on HeaderTitle instead of raw property strings. Set:
- font family to Roboto if available
- typeface to Bold
- size to 30
- letter spacing to 20
- shadow offset to (2, 2)
- shadow color to a mostly opaque black

---

Read the full font config back and verify every field you changed.

---

## Brush API Test

Use the dedicated brush API on the background image. Set:
- draw mode to RoundedBox
- tint to a dark blue color
- margin to 0.2 on every side
- corner radius to 16 on every corner

If a valid engine texture is easy to reference, set that as the brush resource too.

---

Read the brush back and verify the brush fields were applied.

---

## Animation Authoring Test

Create a widget animation called IntroFade.

---

Add a track for HeaderTitle RenderOpacity.

---

Add two keyframes to that track:
- time 0.0 -> value 0.0
- time 0.35 -> value 1.0

Use linear interpolation.

---

List the animations and verify IntroFade exists with at least one track.

---

## Preview Capture Test

Capture a 1280x720 preview PNG of TestWidget into the project's Saved folder.

---

Verify the preview result succeeded and report the output path.

---

## PIE Runtime Test

Start PIE if it is not already running.

---

Spawn TestWidget in PIE and keep the returned handle.

---

Use the live-property API to read HeaderTitle RenderOpacity from the PIE widget instance.

---

Remove the spawned PIE widget and stop PIE.

---

Verify the PIE cleanup completed cleanly.

---

## Anchor Test

In TestWidget2, set the button's anchors to stretch both horizontally and vertically.

---

Verify the anchor settings are correct.

---

## Override-Value Test (bOverride_ companions)

UMG "optional override" values (SizeBox WidthOverride/HeightOverride/MinDesiredWidth, image
aspect-ratio overrides, …) are inert unless their companion bOverride_ bool is set — setting the
value through the widget property API must raise the companion automatically, or the value
silently no-ops (issue #508).

---

Add a SizeBox called "ClampBox" to MainContainer, and put a button inside it.

---

Set ClampBox's width override to 300 and height override to 120 through the widget property API.

---

Read back WidthOverride, HeightOverride, AND the companion flags bOverride_WidthOverride and bOverride_HeightOverride. (Expected: values 300/120 and BOTH companion booleans true — if a companion stayed false, the SizeBox is silently ignoring the value and filling its parent, which is the regression.)

---

Set ClampBox's minimum desired width to 150 and verify bOverride_MinDesiredWidth flipped to true as well.

---

Remove ClampBox and verify the hierarchy is back to how it was.

---

## Cleanup Test

Delete TestWidget2 completely.

---

Verify TestWidget2 no longer exists.

---

Save TestWidget one final time.

---

Open TestWidget in the editor and verify everything compiles without errors.

---

## Final Validation

Count the total number of widgets in TestWidget's hierarchy.

---

List all widgets by name to confirm the complete structure.

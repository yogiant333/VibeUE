description: Unreal Engine 5 development using the VibeUE Python API. Use when working in Unreal Engine — blueprints, state trees, materials, actors, landscapes, animation, niagara, widgets, sound, foliage, gameplay tags, enhanced input, skeletons, PCG (procedural content generation), and more. VibeUE is an extension of Unreal's native MCP endpoint.
---

VibeUE is an **extension on Unreal Engine's native MCP endpoint** (`http://localhost:8000/mcp`).
There is no separate VibeUE server, no API key, and no in-editor chat — VibeUE simply registers
extra Python services (`unreal.<Service>`) and skill packs on top of the engine's own toolsets.

## Wait for VibeUE readiness after launch

`BuildAndLaunchGame.ps1` / `.sh` print `Editor-PID=<pid>` — treat that as the process identity. Check
once, then watch the filesystem for `<ProjectDir>/Saved/VibeUE/Signals/editor-<pid>-true.json` before
using MCP. Wait at most 180 seconds, do not poll MCP while waiting, and fail if that Editor process
exits or the timeout expires. Ignore signal files for other or dead PIDs. The signal only means
`RegisterToolsets()` reached its end; Python, World, and level readiness remain separate checks.

The file is JSON, written atomically, so it is complete the moment it appears:

```json
{"signal":"toolsets-registered","pid":21044,"createdUtc":"2026-08-03T17:04:11.921Z",
 "sessionStartUtc":"2026-08-03T17:03:22.108Z","pluginVersion":"3.0"}
```

Process IDs get recycled. The launch scripts clear a matching stale signal right after starting the
Editor, but if you launch it some other way, verify `sessionStartUtc` is later than the moment you
started the process before trusting the signal.

Skill packs (this file and its siblings) are loaded through the engine's `AgentSkillToolset`.
Each skill carries exact API patterns and gotchas; **load the relevant skill before writing any
code** in a domain, or you will guess wrong property names and spiral into discovery loops.

## Discover and load skills

Skills are discovered and read through the engine `AgentSkillToolset`, invoked with `call_tool`:

```
# List every available skill (full path → description)
call_tool(toolset_name="ToolsetRegistry.AgentSkillToolset", tool_name="ListSkills", arguments={})

# Read one or more skills — GetSkills takes the FULL paths that ListSkills returns
call_tool(toolset_name="ToolsetRegistry.AgentSkillToolset", tool_name="GetSkills",
          arguments={"skillPaths": ["/VibeUE/Python/init_unreal_PY.VibeUE_pcg",
                                    "/VibeUE/Python/init_unreal_PY.VibeUE_materials"]})
```

> **Naming rule (verified live):** skill pack `<slug>` registers as `VibeUE_<slug>` (hyphens →
> underscores) and sub-doc `<slug>/<file>.md` as `VibeUE_<slug>__<file>`, all under the path prefix
> `/VibeUE/Python/init_unreal_PY.`. Short names such as `"pcg"` or `"state-trees/api-reference"`
> return an **empty result with no error** — always pass full paths, taking them from `ListSkills`
> when unsure. Run `describe_toolset` on `ToolsetRegistry.AgentSkillToolset` if the call signature
> differs in your build. The old `vibeue-skills-manager` tool no longer exists.

**Route by functional area.** Find the area whose scope matches the task, then `GetSkills` the
listed skill(s) — full paths per the naming rule above. The *NOT for* column is the disambiguator —
when two areas seem to fit, the one that *excludes* your task is telling you where to go instead.

| Functional area | Use for — **NOT** for… | Load skill(s) |
|---|---|---|
| **Scene & actors** | place / move / arrange / organize / tag actors in a level — NOT gameplay logic (→ Blueprints), NOT world-scale terrain/foliage (→ Environment), NOT attaching a Niagara/particle component (→ VFX) | `level-actors` |
| **Blueprints & gameplay logic** | author Blueprint classes & graphs, Enhanced Input, gameplay tags — NOT AI behavior (→ AI), NOT AnimBP graphs (→ Animation), NOT C++/source (coding-agent handoff) | `blueprints`, `blueprint-graphs`, `enhanced-input`, `gameplay-tags` |
| **AI** | author StateTree logic — states, tasks, transitions, event payloads, delegate bindings — NOT character body animation (→ Animation), NOT generic actor placement (→ Scene) | `state-trees` |
| **Animation & rigging** | AnimBP state machines, AnimSequence keyframes, montages & AnimNotify wiring, bone/skeleton editing & retarget — NOT cinematic timelines (Epic Sequencer), NOT AI movement (→ AI), NOT authoring/adding sound assets — even a character's footstep sounds (→ Audio) | `animation-blueprint`, `animsequence`, `animation-editing`, `animation-montage`, `skeleton` |
| **Materials & shading** | materials, instances, graph nodes, Custom HLSL — NOT Niagara particle materials (→ VFX), NOT landscape auto-materials (→ Environment) | `materials` |
| **VFX (Niagara)** | particle systems, emitters, scratch-pad HLSL, attaching/placing a Niagara component on an actor — NOT surface materials (→ Materials) | `niagara-systems`, `niagara-emitters` |
| **UI (UMG)** | widget blueprints, layout, fonts/brushes, MVVM — NOT the gameplay behind the UI (→ Blueprints) | `umg-widgets` |
| **Environment (world-scale)** | landscape sculpt/paint, landscape materials, foliage, PCG, map blockout, real-world terrain — NOT single-actor placement (→ Scene), NOT sound/audio (→ Audio) | `landscape`, `landscape-materials`, `landscape-auto-material`, `foliage`, `pcg`, `map-blockout`, `terrain-data` |
| **Audio** | MetaSound and SoundCue authoring — creating the sound asset itself: ambient, a character's footstep/foley, UI sounds — NOT triggering sounds from gameplay logic (→ Blueprints), NOT wiring an existing sound to anim-notify foot-plant frames (→ Animation) | `metasounds`, `sound-cues` |
| **Assets, data & project** | import/export assets, UV mapping, enums/structs, engine & project settings — NOT actors placed in a level (→ Scene) | `asset-management`, `uv-mapping`, `enum-struct`, `engine-settings`, `project-settings` |
| **Diagnostics, testing & run** | start/stop/query PIE, profile (CPU-vs-GPU / Insights), uncap frame rate — NOT fixing the logic a bug points to (→ its authoring area) | `pie-testing`, `profiling`, `frame-rate` |
| **Camera & viewport** | viewport camera, view mode, FOV, exposure, layout — NOT material look (→ Materials), NOT placing/editing light actors (→ Scene) | `viewport` |
| **Cinematics · Physics** | Sequencer cinematics and Physics assets (ragdoll/skeletal) are **Epic-native** — VibeUE adds no skill here — NOT enabling simulate-physics on a level actor (→ Scene) | *(none — use `list_toolsets`: `animation_toolset.*` / `PhysicsToolsets`)* |

A loaded skill gives you:
- workflows, gotchas, and property formats for the domain
- `vibeue_classes` / `unreal_classes` — class names to feed into `discover_python_class` for live method signatures
- sub-doc references (`<skill>/<section>`) you can fetch via `GetSkills` for deeper detail

Always call `discover_python_class` on the classes in `vibeue_classes` before writing code — never
guess method names from the skill content alone. **Batch the discovery into ONE call** instead of
one call per class:

```
# ONE call covers all classes and all topics:
discover_python_class(
    class_name="unreal.MaterialService, unreal.WidgetService, unreal.MaterialNodeService",
    method_filter="create|delete|compile|property|color")

# WRONG — three separate calls for three classes wastes round-trips and repeats boilerplate
```

`class_name` accepts a comma-separated list (response gains a `classes` array, one entry per class);
`method_filter` ORs keywords with `|`.

## How work gets done — `execute_python_code` is the workhorse

VibeUE services are plain Python on the editor's `unreal` module. Run everything through
`execute_python_code`:

```python
import unreal
widgets = unreal.WidgetService.list_widget_blueprints()
unreal.StateTreeService.create_state_tree("/Game/AI/MyBehavior")
```

You get the full `unreal.*` API plus every `unreal.<Service>` VibeUE adds. Reserve `call_tool` for
**engine toolsets and skills** (e.g. `AgentSkillToolset`, `EditorToolset.EditorAppToolset`,
`LogsToolset`, `GameplayTagsToolset`, `AssetTools`).

## Tools — what each is for

| Tool | Use it for |
|------|-----------|
| `execute_python_code` | Run `unreal.*` Python in the editor — the workhorse for every VibeUE service |
| `call_tool` | Invoke engine toolsets and skills (skills, PIE control, logs, assets, gameplay tags) |
| `describe_toolset` / `list_toolsets` | Discover engine toolsets and their actions/args |
| `discover_python_class` / `discover_python_function` / `discover_python_module` | Get live signatures before writing code |
| `list_python_subsystems` | Enumerate editor subsystems for `unreal.get_editor_subsystem(...)` |
| `terrain_data` | Real-world heightmaps + water splines (see `terrain-data` skill) |
| `deep_research` | Web research / page fetch / geocoding |

## Engine toolsets replace the old VibeUE tools

Several capabilities that used to be VibeUE-specific MCP tools are now the engine's native toolsets,
called via `call_tool` (run `describe_toolset` for action names/params):

| Need | Engine toolset (via `call_tool`) |
|------|----------------------------------|
| Start / stop / query PIE | `EditorToolset.EditorAppToolset` → `StartPIE` / `StopPIE` / `IsPIERunning` |
| Capture a viewport screenshot | `EditorToolset.EditorAppToolset` → `CaptureViewport` |
| List / read / filter / tail UE logs | `LogsToolset` |
| Search / open / save / move / import assets | `AssetTools` |
| Single-tag gameplay-tag CRUD | `GameplayTagsToolset` (see `gameplay-tags` skill) |

Performance/Insights tracing is the one net-new VibeUE service — `unreal.PerformanceService.*` (see
the `profiling` skill) — because Unreal 5.8 ships no performance toolset.
